# Chatbot with Groq and Streamlit

Welcome to the **AI Chatbot** repository! This project demonstrates a chatbot application powered by **Groq** for efficient AI processing and **Streamlit** for a seamless user interface.

---

## Features

- **Conversational AI:** Powered by Groq, the chatbot provides fast and accurate responses.
- **Streamlit-based UI:** A clean, intuitive interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Customizable Backend:** Easily adapt the Groq model for different use cases.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Host locally or on the cloud.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq SDK installed ([Groq Documentation](https://www.groq.com/documentation))
- Streamlit installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-with-groq.git
   cd chatbot-with-groq
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify Groq setup: Ensure that your Groq system is properly configured. Refer to [Groq's setup guide](https://www.groq.com/documentation) for more details.

## How It Works

### Backend (Groq)

- The chatbot leverages Groq's high-performance processing for real-time conversational AI.
- Groq handles model inference, ensuring rapid response times and low latency.

### Frontend (Streamlit)

- Streamlit provides an interactive UI where users can type messages and view responses in real time.
- The interface includes:
  - Input box for user queries
  - Display area for chatbot responses
  - Customizable theme options

---

## Customization

### Modifying the Model

- Update the `groq_model.py` file to integrate a different model or adjust preprocessing/postprocessing logic.

### UI Customization

- Modify `app.py` to add new features or adjust the Streamlit layout.

---

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

Run the chatbot locally with Streamlit using the steps above.

### Cloud Deployment

- Use platforms like **Streamlit Community Cloud**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud** to host your chatbot online.
- Example Streamlit Cloud deployment:
  1. Push your code to GitHub.
  2. Connect your repository to Streamlit Community Cloud.
  3. Deploy and share your app!

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple languages.
- Integrate additional Groq-optimized models.
- Enhance UI with more user customization options.
- Implement session history for better context retention.
